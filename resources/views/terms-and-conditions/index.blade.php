			<p><strong>1. About www.wedbooker.com</strong></p><p>1.1. Welcome to www.wedbooker.com (the ‘<strong>Platform</strong>’). The Platform is a marketplace for wedding suppliers and venues who have registered (via the Sign-Up page) on the Platform (‘Suppliers/Venues’) to quote on Jobs posted by wedding couples who have registered (via the Sign-Up page) on the Platform (‘Couples’) and for Couples to book and pay for the Quotes they select (the ‘Services’) via the Platfrom.</p><p>1.2. The Platform is operated by wedBooker Australia Pty Ltd (ACN 628 854 446) (“wedBooker”). Access to and use of the Platform, or any of its associated Services, is provided by wedBooker. Please read these terms and conditions (the ‘<strong>Terms and Conditions</strong>‘) carefully. By using, browsing and/or reading the Platform, this signifies that you have read, understood and agree to be bound by the Terms and Conditions. If you do not agree with the Terms and Conditions, you must cease usage of the Platform, or any of Services, immediately.</p><p>1.3. wedBooker reserves the right to review and change any of the Terms and Conditions by updating this page at its sole discretion. When wedBooker updates the Terms and Conditions, it will use reasonable endeavours to provide you with notice of updates to the Terms and Conditions. Any changes to the Terms and Conditions take immediate effect from the date of their publication. Before you continue, we recommend you keep a copy of the Terms and Conditions for your records.</p><p><strong> 2. Acceptance of the Terms</strong></p><p><strong>You accept the Terms and Conditions by remaining on the Platform. You may also accept the Terms and Conditions by clicking Sign-Up or Login to accept or agree to the Terms and Conditions where this option is made available to you by wedBooker in the user interface.</strong></p><p><strong> 3. Scope of wedBooker Services</strong></p><p>3.1. wedBooker provides the Platform only to enable Couples to post Jobs that they need for their wedding or wedding events. Jobs are viewable by all Suppliers/Venues of the Platform.</p><p>3.2. Suppliers/Venues may Quote in response to a Job. These Quotes are only viewable by the Couple who posted the Job.</p><p>3.3. The Couple may revoke or modify a Job at any time before the Couple accepts a Quote by using the Edit Job function. The Supplier/Venue also has the chance to modify the Quote at the Couples’ request or revoke their Quote at any time prior to the Couple accepting the Quote.</p><p>3.4. Upon submitting a Quote, the Supplier/Venue is confirming their availability for the Booking. If the Supplier/Venue is no longer available to fulfil the Quote, they must retract their Quote before the Couple has accepted..</p><p>3.5. wedBooker reserves the right to cancel or remove any Job made prior to the modification permitted in clause 3.3.</p><p>3.6. When the Couple accepts the Quote, they are accepting the conditions, price and details outlined by the Supplier/Venue in the Quote. If they would like changes to the Quote, they should request these from the Supplier/Venue using the In-Built Messaging System before accepting the Quote.</p><p>3.7. Upon creation of the Contract, wedBooker has rendered its Services and the wedBooker Fees are also due and payable. For the avoidance of doubt, this occurs at the time in which the Invoice is paid and the wedBooker Fees are deducted from the Supplier/Venue.</p><p>3.8. Once the Booking is confirmed and Contract is created, the Couple and Supplier/Venue can contact each other by any means, including via the wedBooker Private Messaging System. However, if the Couple and Supplier/Venue wish to vary the Invoice, the Invoice must be varied on the Platform and any Payments in respect of the Invoice must be made via the Payment Facility on the Platform.</p><p>3.9. The Supplier/Venue must perform the Job required under the Contract, unless otherwise agreed between the Couple and Supplier/Venue. If the Supplier/Venue does not perform the Job, a full refund will be required to the Couple in accordance with the Refund Policy at clause 13. The wedBooker Fees will also need to be returned to wedBooker. wedBooker reserves the right to remove the Supplier/Venue from the Platform if the Booking is cancelled by the Supplier/Venue without adequate notice.</p><p>3.10. After the Contract is completed, the Couple is encouraged to provide a rating and review of the Supplier/Venue’s fulfillment of the Job. In addition, wedBooker encourages Couples and Suppliers/Venues to provide feedback to wedBooker on the wedBooker Services provided. Such feedback can be provided on the Contact Us page on the Platform.</p><p>3.11. wedBooker will in some circumstances enable Couples to request a Quote for their Job from a particular Supplier/Venue. When this occurs, the Supplier/Venue will be automatically notified of the new Job and that the Couple would like the Supplier/Venue to provide a Quote if they are available to provide the Wedding Services required under the Job.</p><p><strong> 4.
